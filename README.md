This is an open source library that lets you create and manage advanced routes for HTTP requests.

[![Latest Stable Version](http://poser.pugx.org/initphp/router/v)](https://packagist.org/packages/initphp/router) [![Total Downloads](http://poser.pugx.org/initphp/router/downloads)](https://packagist.org/packages/initphp/router) [![Latest Unstable Version](http://poser.pugx.org/initphp/router/v/unstable)](https://packagist.org/packages/initphp/router) [![License](http://poser.pugx.org/initphp/router/license)](https://packagist.org/packages/initphp/router) [![PHP Version Require](http://poser.pugx.org/initphp/router/require/php)](https://packagist.org/packages/initphp/router)

## Features

- Full support for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH, HEAD and ANY request methods.
- Variable request methods with (Laravel-like) `$_REQUEST['_method']`. (Default is off, optionally can be activated)
- Controller support. (HomeController@about or HomeController::about)
- Middleware/Filter (before and after) support.
- Static and dynamic route patterns.
- Ability to create custom parameter pattern.
- Namespace support.
- Route grouping support.
- Domain-based routing support.
- Ability to define custom 404 errors
- Ability to name routes
- Ability to call a class in (Symfony-like) callable functions or parameters of controller methods.
- Routing by request ports.
- Routing by client IP address (Via `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']`. Locally, this value can be something like `::1` or `127.0.0.1`.)
- A directory path can be defined as a virtual link.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.2 or later
- Apache is; **AllowOverride All** should be set to and **mod_rewrite** should be on.
- Any library that implements the [Psr-7 HTTP Message Interface](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) and an emitter written for Psr-7. For example; [InitPHP HTTP](https://github.com/InitPHP/HTTP) Library

## Installation

```
composer require initphp/router
```

Is Apache `.htaccess`

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [L]
```

Is NGINX;

```
server {
	listen 80;
	server_name myinitphpdomain.dev;
	root /var/www/myInitPHPDomain/public;
	index index.php;
	location / {
		try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
	}
	location ~ \.php$ {
		fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
		fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php7.4-fpm.sock;
		fastcgi_index index.php;
		include fastcgi.conf;
		fastcgi_intercept_errors on;
	}
}
```

## Configuration

```php
$config = [
    'paths'                 => [
        'controller'            => null, //The full path to the directory where the Controller classes are kept.
        'middleware'            => null, //The full path to the directory where the Middleware classes are kept.
    ],
    'namespaces'            => [
        'controller'            => null, //Namespace prefix of Controller classes, if applicable.
        'middleware'            => null, //Namespace prefix of Middleware classes, if applicable.
    ],
    'base_path'             => '/', // If you are working in a subdirectory; identifies your working directory.
    'variable_method'       => false, // It makes the request method mutable with Laravel-like $_REQUEST['_method'].
    'argument_new_instance' => false, // This configuration is used for Request and Response objects that you want as arguments.
];
```

## Usage

The following example uses the [InitPHP HTTP](https://github.com/InitPHP/HTTP) library. If you wish, you can use this library using the command below, or you can perform similar operations using another library that uses the Psr-7 HTTP Message interface.

```
composer require initphp/http
```

_**See the Wiki for detailed documentation.**_

```php
require_once "vendor/autoload.php";
use \InitPHP\HTTP\Message\{Request, Response, Stream};
use \InitPHP\HTTP\Emitter\Emitter;
use \InitPHP\Router\Router;

$request = Request::createFromGlobals();
$response = new Response();

// Create the router object.
$router = new Router($request, $response, []);

// ... Create routes.
$router->get('/', function () {
    return 'Hello World!';
});

$router->post('/login', function (Request $request, Response $response) {
    return $response->json([
        'status'        => 0,
        'message'       => 'Unauthorized',
    ], 401);
});

// If you do not make a definition for 404 errors; An exception is thrown if there is no match with the request.
$router->error_404(function () {
    echo 'Page Not Found';
});

// Resolve the current route and get the generated HTTP response object.
$response = $router->dispatch();

// Publish the HTTP response object.
$emitter = new Emitter;
$emitter->emit($response);
```
